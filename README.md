# avalon-travel-customer-journey-optimization
Objective of analysis is to optimize the customer journey and the digital marketing spending overall for a mock travel agency called Avalon.

Some tasks include: perform preliminary EDA using data collected on online purchase journeys from a consumer panel. (Purchases are travel bookings, in this case). Some typical customer journeys analyzed included: How do consumers use the different types of touchpoints? Were there potential connections between certain customer demographics and characteristics of their online purchase journeys?

The file dataset_journeys contains data on touchpoints that consumers in the panel have gone through. Purchase journeys don’t always end in a purchase, or if they do it can also be a purchase from a competitor travel agency. The file dataset_customers contains data on consumer demographics obtained via a survey sent to all the
consumers in the panel.

Many of the variables are categorical variables, and some of the categories in this data are “not applicable”, “don’t know”. There are also some missing values where consumers did not reply to the survey.
